                <h2>Benefit of Meditation</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    Because it calms the mind and lowers cortisol levels, meditation has major mental health advantages, including reduced stress, anxiety, and depression. By reducing blood pressure, strengthening the heart, and boosting sleep quality, it also enhances physical health. Additionally, by enhancing attention, concentration, and even delaying age-related changes in the brain, meditation improves cognitive function. 
                </blockquote>
