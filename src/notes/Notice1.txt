I write this note to declare the major website structure alternation and their justification.

1. For JournalView: 
    Hold on the personality test implementation as it takes some periods to gather the questions and evaluation.
    (MBTI and Enneagram)
2. For CommunityView:
    Demolish the mutual discussion board, as in terms of mental health, we need safe space.
    Adding the mutual discussion board increases risk of trespassing, including posting harmful contents or circle jerking.
    But, the discussion board for each community still available as they are controlled by their owners.
    (As a social worker, I want to grant access to my communities to provide social spaces for youths.)
