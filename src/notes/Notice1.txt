I write this note to declare the major website structure alternation and their justification.

1. For JournalView: 
    Hold on the personality test implementation as it takes some periods to gather the questions and evaluation.
    (MBTI and Enneagram)
2. For CommunityView:
    Demolish the mutual discussion board, as in terms of mental health, we need safe space.
    Adding the mutual discussion board increases risk of trespassing, including posting harmful contents or circle jerking.
    But, the discussion board for each community still available as they are controlled by their owners.
    Some community may not have physical location, instead, they can use virtual location.
    (Like I host my office virtually @ Singapore)
    (As a social worker, I want to grant access to my communities to provide social spaces for youths.)
3. For EducationView:
    The form for adding Article is not implemented yet, as it requires special roles.
    Allowing anyone writing article increases risk of spreading rumors or misinformation.
4. For ProfileView:
    After authorisation system is implemented, I will allow the profile editing.
5. For HomeView:
    There is nothing implemented yet. In the future, I will provide the different views (unauthorised vs authorised)
6. Databases:
    All data are hardcoded in each views for displaying, unless Firebase is implemented. In this case, all hardcoded data are deleted IMMEDIATELY to prevent unauthorised code accessing.
